**I'm Mikey üòÅ**

I code in Python, PHP (Laravel) and SASS.

I'm Mohammad H. Maazallahi, also known as Mikey. A programmer who loves improving upon existing products, creating new innovative products and automating all of my life through tech! I'm currently open-to-hire and also open to collaborate on many different projects!

**Love working to create innovative technology? Me, too!**

Hit me up if you have anything to collaborate on, otherwise, enjoy my set of personal projects!
