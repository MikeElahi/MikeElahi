#### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹
1. ðŸš€ I'm a Software Engineer and Developer Advocate at @vandarpay, Ask me for help on our projects!
2. ðŸŒ§ I re-wrote and maintain [Aloodak](https://github.com/WiGeeky/aloodak), a Telegram Bot reporting pollution in major Iranian cities [(See in Action)](https://t.me/aloodak]
3. ðŸ“š In my free time, I enjoy editing articles on Wikipedia and working on Wikidata.
4. ðŸ’¬ I'm open to collaborations on interesting software projects, get in touch through hey@mikey.ir


if you like the projects I've worked on and want to support my work, consider [buying me a coffee](https://vandar.io/request/M38KUJ5U28) (Iranian nationals only, due to US Treasury Laws) or contacting me for collaboration.
